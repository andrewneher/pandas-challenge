Homework Assignment for Northwestern Bootcamp

Andrew Neher's Homework Submission
Ran into problems at the end of this assignment. I thought I had this figured it out, but once the aggregated data accumulated, I lost track of how to pull the proper values. I got confused at the end.

Also, I'm not sure why the tables are not displaying correctly in GitLab. They were displaying correctly in Pandas.
